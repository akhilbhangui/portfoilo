 <h3 class="section-title">Ethics and Responsibilities</h3>
 <div class="vtbegenerated"> 
 <p>While I was working on my Individual project, I learnt about malpractices that might arise in a research environment. As I was working on a Human prosthetic device, I was asked to complete few certifications in order to conduct my research. While completing these certifications, I learnt about conflict of interest, unethical and financial malpractices, discriminatory practices while conducting research, etc. These certifications helped me in recognising types of malpractices that might occur during research.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>An example of above malpractices that I have learnt is regarding coercing test subjects for performing dangerous tests for research. The test subjects for a research must never be forced into any activity they dont want to participate in. This violates their rights and such unethical practice should not be done in any research environment.</p> 
 <p>Similarly, another malpractice that might be possible in research environment is breach of confidentiality. In an research environment, when the test subject has agreed to perform the research, their private data should never be released to any third party.</p>

 <h3 class="section-title">Collaboration in group assignments</h3>
 <div class="vtbegenerated">
 <p>Working in teams is a good way to reduce work load of completing the entire project. In my Robotics course, I struggled with MATLAB as it was a new skill for me to aquire but at the same time I had a good grasp of the math and physics required for solving complex equations. Hence when I stuggled in the programming aspect of the course I was useful in the analytical part and was supported by my teammates who had good grasp of MATLAB. In this way, I could support the person that struggled with math part while I asked for help with the programming part. This helped us to complete our assignments within the given deadline and help each other improve in skills which we lacked.</p> 
 <p>While the above case is the best case scenario, I have also observed people not working themselves and taking advantage of their peers to get get assignments completed.</p>
