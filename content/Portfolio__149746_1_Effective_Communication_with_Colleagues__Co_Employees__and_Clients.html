 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;font-family: helvetica , arial , sans-serif;">In my endeavor as a graduate student, I have had to present my work to different people, teams, and panels of varying sizes, knowledge, and skill levels. These presentations have helped me improve my communication skills and gain confidence in front of large audiences.&nbsp;</span><br><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;font-family: helvetica , arial , sans-serif;">While working on the group projects for my course in Robotics, we had to present our findings from research papers for robotics programming with force control. This project helped me to understand the process of conducting research in an academic scenario. My team and I succeeded in presenting our thoughts perfectly regarding our findings about the research topic. This project helped me gain in-depth knowledge of force control in robotics. We were also successful in clarifying all the doubts among our classmates.</span><br><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;font-family: helvetica , arial , sans-serif;">Similarly, in the Musculoskeletal Biomechanics course, I worked on a group project to design a prosthetic device to improve the gait pattern of patients suffering from hemiplegic gait. This project was challenging as we had to consider many possibilities for our prosthetic device to work. We had to present our research to the class in the allowed time, which meant the presentation had to be to the point and relevant to the topic. This project helped me improve my presentation skills under a time crunch.</span><br><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;font-family: helvetica , arial , sans-serif;">While working on my individual project, I had to research different types of controllers and present them in the lab among fellow labmates. This helped me improve my presentation skills and enabled me to gain better knowledge about controller design.&nbsp;</span></p>
